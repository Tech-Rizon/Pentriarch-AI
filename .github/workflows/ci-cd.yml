# ===== WORKFLOW SUMMARY =====
# This CI/CD pipeline provides:
# 1. ?? Automated quality assurance (type checking, linting, build verification)
# 2. ??? Security scanning and dependency analysis
# 3. ?? Automatic preview deployments for pull requests (via Vercel GitHub Integration)
# 4. ?? Production deployment on main branch merges (via Vercel GitHub Integration)
# 5. ? Post-deployment verification and health checks
# 6. ?? Comprehensive logging and status reporting
#
# NOTE: Vercel's native GitHub integration handles the actual deployment.
# This workflow performs quality checks and coordinates the deployment process.
